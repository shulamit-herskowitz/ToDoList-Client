# ToDo List App - React Integration

This project focuses on the **integration** of a React-based user interface with a custom .NET backend API. The main objective was to connect a pre-existing UI to a live data source and manage full-stack communication.

## 🏗️ Integration Highlights
* **API Connection:** Configured the application to communicate with a remote .NET API hosted on Render.
* **Service Implementation:** Completed the `service.js` logic using **Axios** to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **Axios Interceptors:** Implemented interceptors for global error handling and response logging.
* **Environment Management:** Used environment variables to manage dynamic API URLs for different deployment stages.
* **Modern Styling:** Custom CSS updates to provide a vibrant Dark Mode experience and improved UX.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Library:** React.js
* **HTTP Client:** Axios
* **Deployment:** Render (Static Site)
